### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**yakuter/yakuter** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Passwall which is an open source password manager written with Go and Electron Vue
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning javascript
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with PassWall
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Golang and architecture
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: yakuter@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Coding is not a job, it is a life style ;)
